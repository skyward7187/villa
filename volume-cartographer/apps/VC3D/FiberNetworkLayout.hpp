// Extrinsic unroll of manually linked H/V fiber networks about the scroll
// umbilicus, ported from scripts/fiber_network_unroll.py.
//
//     x = unwrapped angle about the umbilicus * the network's median radius
//     y = z
//
// Everything here is in voxels of the frame the fibers are annotated in, input
// and output alike: the layout never learns the voxel size and so cannot get it
// wrong. Turning a voxel count into a physical length is the caller's business,
// and only when it actually knows the voxel size. The tuning lengths in
// LayoutParams are voxels too; their defaults are documented below.
//
// Each fiber's unwrapped angle carries its own arbitrary multiple of 2*pi, so
// the offsets are made mutually consistent by walking the link graph and
// snapping each fiber to the nearest whole turn of an already-placed
// neighbour (best-agreeing link first). Crossings then coincide and loops
// close by construction: there is no solver and no accumulated drift. A link
// whose endpoints still disagree by a large fraction of a turn afterwards was
// annotated on the wrong winding and is reported as suspect.
